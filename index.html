    <b>"Wait, what? I thought this site was supposed to be about data science? What's with the poem?"</b>
    <br>   
    
    <p>Thanks to a fantastic literature professor, Dr. Richard Begam, The Second Coming has been a favorite of mine for years. Beyond
      this poem, Yeats had <a href="http://www.yeatsvision.com/geometry.html">an intense fascination with gyres</a> that went far beyond just this poem.</p>

      <p>To me, the gyre is another metaphor for the eternal ebb and flow / swinging
      pendulum / yin and yang of life. Technological advancements have increased the velocity of life and expanded its cirmcumference,
      allowing us to consume more, faster. This has driven tremendous economic, social, cultural and political change, causing
      all aspects of society to simultaneously converge and diverge in new and unexpected ways. The rise of big data is a byproduct
      of all of this -- made possible by developments that have increased compute power and storage while reducing costs, and
      made necessary by our desire to track and predict the shifting trajectories of the gyres of life.</p>

      <p>The rest of the site is divided into three sections:
        <ol>
          <li><b>Coursework</b>:  assessments and projects I completed in connection with the Springboard Data Science Career Track program.</li>
          <li><b>Notes</b>:  If I had to look it up, I try to write it down somewhere I can find it again.  This is that place.</li>
          <li><b>Posts</b>:  Mostly links to things I might want to read again in the future.</li>
        </ol>

    <h4>The Second Coming</h4>
    <p>Turning and turning in the widening gyre</p>
    <p>The falcon cannot hear the falconer;</p>
    <p>Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;</p>
    <p>Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,</p>
    <p>The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere</p>
    <p>The ceremony of innocence is drowned;</p>
    <p>The best lack all conviction, while the worst</p>
    <p>Are full of passionate intensity.</p>
    <br>

    <p>Surely some revelation is at hand;</p>
    <p>Surely the Second Coming is at hand.</p>
    <p>The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out</p>
    <p>When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi</p>
    <p>Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert</p>
    <p>A shape with lion body and the head of a man,</p>
    <p>A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,</p>
    <p>Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it</p>
    <p>Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.</p>
    <p>The darkness drops again; but now I know</p>
    <p>That twenty centuries of stony sleep</p>
    <p>Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,</p>
    <p>And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,</p>
    <p>Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?</p>
    <br>
