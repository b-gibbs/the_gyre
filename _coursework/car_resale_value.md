## Car Resale Value  
<br>
__What is the problem you want to solve?__  
Predict actual resale value of used cars in the Austin, Texas area, including factors like make, model, model year, mileage and CarFax report.  
<br>
__Who is your client and why do they care about this problem? In other words, what will your client DO or DECIDE based on your analysis that they wouldnâ€™t have otherwise?__  
Anyone interested in selling their car.  
<br>
__What data are you going to use for this? How will you acquire this data?__  
I'll scrape the CarFax website with BeautifulSoup and / or Scrapy.  
<br>
__In brief, outline your approach to solving this problem (knowing that this might change later).__  
After engineering the features, I'll go down the linear regression chain to determine best model fit while balancing interpretability vs. fit.  
<br>
__What are your deliverables? Typically, this would include code, along with a paper and/or a slide deck.__  
Code and a slide deck
