## The Qualities of a Successful NFL Cornerback  
<br>
### What is the problem you want to solve?  
What qualities are most important in determining a successful NFL cornerback?  NCAA success doesn't necessarily translate directly to a successful career in the NFL for players of all positions.  What qualities can recruiters focus on to find players most likely to succeed at cornerback in the NFL?  Once the qualities with the highest correlation to success have been identified, can logistic regression be used to determine the percentage chance of being employed by an NFL team by year 5 for players with characteristics in the success range?

### Who is your client and why do they care about this problem? In other words, what will your client DO or DECIDE based on your analysis that they wouldnâ€™t have otherwise?  
The client is the Green Bay Packers.  They've had a hard time attracting and retaining quality cornerbacks.  They've relied heavily on a draft and develop philosophy (changing this year with new management), and they've drafted a number of players for their secondary, but most have washed out.  Look at a combination of NCAA stats, NFL combine results and physical characteristics to predict whether a player will be a starter by the end of the 4th year, or, whether they'll be signed with a team for at least five years.

### What data are you going to use for this? How will you acquire this data?  
<ul>
  <li>NCAA stats</li>
  <li>GPA, makor and school ranking?</li>
  <li>physical attributes</li>
  <li>injury stats</li>
  <li>NFL combine scores</li>
</ul>
<br>
### In brief, outline your approach to solving this problem (knowing that this might change later).  
Look at all cornerbacks that entered the NFL from 2000 - 2013.  EDA and summary stats to determine what percentage survive at least five years in the NFL.  Look for the qualities that differentiate these players from those who sign immediately after college but fail to stay in the NFL for five years.

### What are your deliverables? Typically, this would include code, along with a paper and/or a slide deck.  
Code + slide deck + time permitting, a D3.js dashboard where a recruiter can enter a player's characteristics and get a % likelihood of success.

**Challenges**  The NFL is changing.  The roles cornerbacks are being asked to play are changing and the physical characteristics they require are also changing.  The shifting landscape may skew results.
