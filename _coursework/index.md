<p>This section contains work I completed in connection with Springboard's Data Science Career Track program during the Spring and Summer of 2018.</p>

<h3>PROJECTS</h3>
<br>
<h4>NFL Defensive Back Success</h4>
<p>This is a supervised classification project that attempts to predict the success of a college defensive back.  I looked at biographical statistics and NCAA Division I (FBS) game statistics for over 7,000 players and the NFL Combine evaluation scores for over 1,000 players to determine whether it was possible to predict their success in the NFL.  Success was set to be at least three years of play in the NFL.  The project uses a variety of machine learning classification techniques, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Random Forests, AdaBoost and XGBoost. </p>

<br>
<h4>What Moves AAPL?</h4>
<p>This is a regression problem that attempts to predict movements in AAPL stock price during the ten days surrounding an AAPL earnings announcement.  I used sentiment analysis to examine transcripts of earnings calls, as well as writings by research analysts both prior to an announcement and in reaction to the earnings reports.</p>

</br>
<h4>Take Home Challenges</h4>
<p>"Relax" and "Ultimate" are two short projects meant to mimic take home projects a hypothetical employer might ask an applicant to complete.</p>

</br>
<h4>Statistics</h4>
<p>Short problems designed to strengthen one's statistical analysis skills.</p>

</br>
<h4>Machine Learning</h4>
<p>Short projects exploring four different machine learning algorithms.</p>
