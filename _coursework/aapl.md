## The Impact of Special Events on the Value of AAPL Since 2004

**What is the problem you want to solve?**
<p>Predict movement in AAPL share price prior to and immediately after an earnings announcement.  Look at the correlation between Apple's guidance, street expectations, the actual announced earnings and stock price over a period of 10 market days (5 prior and 5 post).  What factors have the highest correlation to movements?  Is there consistent correlation?  Does the company's fundamentals have any real bearing on this movement?</p>
  
<p>For years there was a gap between earnings guidance, street expectations and earnings announced.  What is the relationship between these and is there an opportunity to capitalize on this gap?</p>

Could also use NLP / sentiment analysis to factor in analysts' predictions and reactions to earnings.  
- MG Siegler  
- John Gruber  
- Morgan analyst  
- GS analyst?  
  
**Who is your client and why do they care about this problem? In other words, what will your client DO or DECIDE based on your analysis that they wouldnâ€™t have otherwise?**  
I'm the client and I want to know if there's a strategic investment opportunity with AAPL stock around their earnings announcements.  
<br>
**What data are you going to use for this? How will you acquire this data?**  
AAPL stock data, earnings data and company fundamentals, all of which can be found on a variety of sites.  
<br>
**In brief, outline your approach to solving this problem (knowing that this might change later).**
- collect the data
- separate out data from the periods surrounding earnings announcements
- use linear regression and its variants to look for correlations to share price


**What are your deliverables? Typically, this would include code, along with a paper and/or a slide deck.**
