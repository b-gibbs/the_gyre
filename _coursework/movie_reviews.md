## Compare Reviews and Ratings of Movie-Goers vs. Film Critics
<br>
__What is the problem you want to solve?__  
Are professional reviews relevant to the average movie-goer?  How do professional reviews correlate with commercial success at the box office?  
<br>
__Who is your client and why do they care about this problem? In other words, what will your client DO or DECIDE based on your analysis that they wouldnâ€™t have otherwise?__  
Movie studio executives deciding on which scripts to support and produce.  
<br>
__What data are you going to use for this? How will you acquire this data?__  
MetaCritic, IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes  
<br>
__In brief, outline your approach to solving this problem (knowing that this might change later).__  
Use NLP to compare key words in both types of reviews to see what aspects of movies professional and non-professional reviewers are focuse on.  Use TextBlob to compare the sentiments of the textual reviews with the final score given to films by both professional and non-professional reviews.

__What are your deliverables? Typically, this would include code, along with a paper and/or a slide deck.__
